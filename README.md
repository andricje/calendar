# MMA Calendar

A free and open source way to subscribe to calendars from multiple MMA organizations. 
 - One Championship calendar. https://www.onefccalendar.com
 - UFC https://www.ufc.com

## How it works

- Scrape events page for event details
- Create and publish ics calendar
- Update regularly

## Whats the catch?

This sounded like a fun project that I wanted for my own use. Couldnt find a subscribable calendar so I made it myself. Theres no strings attached, no trackers, no ads.
